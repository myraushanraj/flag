						<h2>1. Accepting These Terms </h2>
					</div>
					<div class="container terms-details">
						<p>This document and the other documents that we reference below make up our house rules, or what we officially
							call our Terms of Use (the “Terms” for short). </p>
						<br />
						<p>The Terms are a legally binding contract between you and Flagship. If you live in North America or South
							America, the contract is between you and Flagship, Inc.; if you live elsewhere, the contract is between you
							and Flagship. </p>
						<br />
						<p>Please note that Section 11 contains an arbitration clause and class action waiver, applicable to users in
							North and South America, and explains how to opt out of arbitration. Unless you validly opt out, you agree
							to resolve any disputes with Flagship exclusively through binding individual arbitration, with only limited
							exceptions. This means you and Flagship are waiving the right to sue in court, have a trial by jury, or
							participate in a class or representative action. Please read this Section carefully, as it affects your
							rights. </p>
						<br />
						<p>This contract sets out your rights and responsibilities when you use Flagship.com, Pattern by Flagship, our
							mobile apps, and the other services provided by Flagship (we’ll refer to all of these collectively as our
							“Services”), so please read it carefully. By using any of our Services (even just browsing one of our
							websites or apps), you’re agreeing to the Terms. If you don’t agree with the Terms, you may not use our
							Services. Agree with us? Great, read on! </p>
						<br />
						<p>Flagship’s Services connect people around the world, both online and offline, to make, sell, and buy unique
							goods. Here’s a handy guide to help you understand the specific rules that are relevant for you, depending
							on how you use the Services. Through our mentorship program we guide young entrepreneurs on the ins and outs
							of entrepreneurship.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="Restrictions-condition">
						<h2>2. Your Privacy</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="container terms-details">
						<p>We know your personal information is important to you, so it’s important to us. Our Privacy Policy details
							how your information is collected, used and shared when you use our Services. By using our Services, you're
							also agreeing that we can process your information in the ways set out in the Privacy Policy, so please read
							it. </p>
						<br />
						<p>Both Flagship and sellers process members’ personal information (for example, buyer name, email address, and
							delivery address) and are therefore considered separate and independent data controllers of buyers’ personal
							information under EU law. That means that each party is responsible for the personal information it
							processes in providing the Services. For example, if a seller accidentally discloses a buyer’s name and
							email address when fulfilling another buyer’s order, the seller, not Flagship, will be responsible for that
							unauthorized disclosure. </p>
						<br />
						<p>If, however, you (as a seller) and Flagship are found to be joint data controllers of buyers’ personal
							information, and if Flagship is sued, fined, or otherwise incurs expenses because of something that you did
							(or failed to do) as a joint data controller of buyer personal information, then you agree to defend and
							indemnify Flagship in accordance with Section 9 below. </p>
					</div>
				
					<div class="Restrictions-condition">
						<h2>3. Your Account with Flagship </h2>
					</div>
					<div class="container terms-details">
						<p>You’ll need to create an account with Flagship to use some of our Services. Here are a few rules about
							accounts with Flagship: </p>
						<br />
						<p>A. Minors under 18 and at least 13 years of age are only permitted to use our Services through an account
							owned by a parent or legal guardian with their appropriate permission and under their direct supervision.
							Children under 13 years are not permitted to use Flagship or the Services. You/Parent/Legal Guardian will be
							responsible for any and all account activity conducted by a minor on your account, and there may be
							commercial products or services available that you may want to consider to limit a minor's access to
							material online. </p>
						<br />
						<p>B. Be honest with us. Provide accurate information about yourself. It’s prohibited to use false information
							or impersonate another person or company through your account. </p>
						<br />
						<p>C. Choose an appropriate name. If you decide to not have your full name serve as the name associated with
							your account, you may not use language that is offensive, vulgar, infringes someone’s intellectual property
							rights, or otherwise violates the Terms. </p>
						<br />
						<p>D. You're responsible for your account. You’re solely responsible for any activity on your account. If you’re
							sharing an account with other people, then the person whose financial information is on the account will
							ultimately be responsible for all activity. If you’re registering as a business entity, you personally
							guarantee that you have the authority to agree to the Terms on behalf of the business. Also, your accounts
							are not transferable. </p>
						<br />
						<p>E. Protect your password. As we mentioned above, you’re solely responsible for any activity on your account,
							so it’s important to keep your account password secure. </p>
						<br />
						<p>F. Let's be clear about our relationship. These Terms don't create any agency, partnership, joint venture,
							employment, or franchisee relationship between you and Flagship. </p>
						<br />
						<p>G. Cases and Appeals. To participate in our case system (as described in Section 10), or to appeal an action
							by Flagship, you must have an account. </p>
						<br />
						<p>H. You agree to pay 5% on sale of products through Flagship website. </p>
						<br />
						<p>I. We will charge 2.9% and 30c as gateway fees. </p>
						<br />
					</div>
				
					<div class="Restrictions-condition">
						<h2>4. Your Content </h2>
					</div>
					<div class="container terms-details">
						<p>Content that you post using our Services is your content (so let’s refer to it as “Your Content”). We don’t
							make any claim to it, which includes anything you post using our Services (like shop names, profile
							pictures, listing photos, listing descriptions, reviews, comments, videos, usernames, etc.). </p>
						<br />
						<p>A. Responsibility for Your Content. You understand that you are solely responsible for Your Content. You
							represent that you have all necessary rights to all parts of Your Content and that you’re not infringing or
							violating any third party’s rights by posting it. </p>
						<br />
						<p>B. Permission to Use Your Content. By posting Your Content through our Services, you grant Flagship and, as
							authorized by Flagship in its sole discretion, third parties, a license to use it. We don’t claim any
							ownership to Your Content, but we have your permission to use it to help Flagship function and grow. That
							way, we won’t infringe any rights you have in Your Content and we can help promote it. For example, you
							acknowledge and agree Flagship may offer you or Flagship buyers promotions on the Site, from time to time,
							that may relate to your listings or other listings on Flagship. </p>
						<br />
						<p>C. Rights You Grant Flagship. (Here’s the legalese version of the last section). By posting Your Content, you
							grant Flagship and, as authorized by Flagship in its sole discretion, third parties, a non-exclusive,
							worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, sub-licensable, perpetual license to use, display, edit, modify,
							reproduce, distribute, store, and prepare derivative works of Your Content. This allows us to provide the
							Services and to promote Flagship, your Flagship shop, other shops and listings, or the Services in general,
							in any formats and through any channels, including across any Flagship Services, our partners, or
							third-party website or advertising medium. You agree not to assert any moral rights or rights of publicity
							against us for using Your Content. You also recognize our legitimate interest in using it, in accordance
							with the scope of this license, to the extent Your Content contains any personal information. </p>
						<br />
						<p>That sounds like a lot, but it’s necessary for us to keep Flagship going. Consider these examples: if you
							upload a photo or video of a listing on your Flagship shop, we have permission to display it to buyers, and
							we can resize or enhance it so it looks good to a buyer using our mobile app; if you post a description in
							English, we can translate it into French so a buyer in Paris can learn the story behind your item; and if
							you post a beautiful photo or video of your latest handmade necklace, we can feature it - often along with
							your shop name and shop picture - on our homepage, in one of our blogs or even on a billboard to help
							promote your business and Flagship’s. </p>
						<br />
						<p>D. Reporting Unauthorized Content. Flagship has great respect for intellectual property rights, and is
							committed to following appropriate legal procedures to remove infringing content from the Services. If
							content that you own or have rights to has been posted to the Services without your permission and you want
							it removed, please mail us at our official email account info@flagship.club If Your Content is alleged to
							infringe another person’s intellectual property, we will take appropriate action, such as disabling it if we
							receive a report of infringement that complies with our policies, or terminating your account if you are
							found to be a repeat infringer. We’ll notify you if any of that happens. </p>
						<br />
						<p>E. Inappropriate, False, or Misleading Content. This should be common sense, but there are certain types of
							content we don’t want posted on Flagship’s Services (for legal reasons or otherwise). You agree that you
							will not post any content that is abusive, threatening, defamatory, obscene, vulgar, or otherwise offensive
							content. You also agree not to post any content that is false and misleading or uses the Services in a
							manner that is fraudulent or deceptive. </p>
						<br />
					</div>
				
					<div class="Restrictions-condition">
						<h2>5. Parental Consent </h2>
					</div>
					<div class="container terms-details">
						<p>I, hereby grant permission to Flagship.club to use photographs, audio recordings, and video footage of my
							child, taken during the [Flagship Camp/Entrepreneurship Course] for the purposes of creation of digital
							content , website, promotion, marketing, branding, and other related activities both online and offline of
							my child company and of flagship.club. I understand that the photographs, audio recordings, and video
							footage may be used by Flagship.club for various purposes, including but not limited to: Promotion of my
							child startup shop/ page/ business and flagship programs, services, and events. Displaying on flagship & of
							my child website/ page, social media platforms, and other online channels. Inclusion in printed materials,
							such as brochures, flyers, and newsletters of both my child startup as well as of flagship.club.

							social media channels, branding & marketing of their company. I further understand and agree that the
							photographs, audio recordings, and video footage may be edited, cropped, altered, or modified as deemed

							the Flagship Camp/Entrepreneurship Course is voluntary, and I release Flagship.club and its representatives
							from any liability or claims arising from the use of the photographs, audio recordings, and video footage as

							by third parties beyond Flagship.club control once they are made publicly available. This consent and
							release form shall remain in effect until revoked in writing by the undersigned. </p>
					</div>
				
					<div class="Restrictions-condition">
						<h2>6. Your Use of Our Services </h2>
					</div>
					<div class="container terms-details">
						<p>License to Use Our Services. We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license
							to use our Services - subject to the Terms and the following restrictions in particular: </p>
						<br />
						<p>A. Don’t Use Our Services to Break the Law. You agree that you will not violate any laws in connection with
							your use of the Services. This includes any local, state, federal, and international laws that may apply to
							you. For example, it’s your responsibility to obtain any permits or licenses that your shop requires, and to
							meet applicable legal requirements in applicable jurisdiction(s). This includes the sale and delivery of
							your items, such as age verification upon delivery, where required by law. You may not sell anything that
							prohibits the laws; and you may not engage in fraud (including false claims or infringement notices), theft,
							anti-competitive conduct, threatening conduct, or any other unlawful acts or crimes against Flagship,
							another Flagship user, or a third party. </p>
						<br />
						<p>B. Pay Your Bills. You are responsible for paying all fees that you owe to Flagship. Except as set forth
							below, you are also solely responsible for collecting and/or paying any applicable taxes for any purchases
							or sales you make through our Services. Where applicable, Flagship will calculate, collect and remit
							value-added tax or VAT and sales tax. Some countries may refer to VAT using other terms, e.g. Goods and
							Services Tax (GST), but we’ll just refer to VAT, GST, and any local sales taxes collectively as “VAT”. </p>
						<br />
						<p>C. Don’t Steal Our Stuff. You agree not to crawl, scrape, or spider any page of the Services or to reverse
							engineer or attempt to obtain the source code of the Services (including both Flagship Intellectual Property
							and Seller Content) without our express permission. </p>
						<br />
						<p>D. Don’t Try to Harm Our Systems. You agree not to interfere with or try to disrupt our Services, for example
							by distributing a virus, excessive requests to our site or platform, or other harmful computer code. </p>
						<br />
						<p>E. Follow Our Trademark Policy. The name "Flagship" and the other Flagship marks, phrases, logos, and designs
							that we use in connection with our Services (the Flagship Trademarks), are trademarks, service marks, or
							trade dress of Flagship in the US and other countries.</p>
						<br />
						<p>F. Share Your Ideas. We love your suggestions and ideas! They can help us improve your experience and our
							Services. Any ideas or other materials you submit to Flagship (not including Your Content or items you sell
							through our Services) are considered non-confidential and non-proprietary to you. You grant us a
							non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, sub-licensable, perpetual license to use and publish
							those ideas and materials for any purpose, without compensation to you. </p>
						<br />
						<p>G. Talk to Us Online. From time to time, Flagship will provide you with certain legal information in writing.
							It says that we can send you information electronically (such as by email) instead of mailing you paper
							copies (it’s better for the environment), and that your electronic agreement is the same as your signature
							on paper. </p>
					</div>
				
					<div class="Restrictions-condition">
						<h2>7. Termination </h2>
					</div>
					<div class="container terms-details">
						<p>Termination By You. We'd hate to see you go, but you may terminate your account with Flagship at any time
							from your account settings. Terminating your account will not affect the availability of some of Your
							Content that you posted through the Services prior to termination. Oh, and you’ll still have to pay any
							outstanding bills. </p>
						<br />
						<p>Termination By Flagship. We may terminate or suspend your account (and any accounts Flagship determines are
							related to your account) and your access to the Services should we have reason to believe you, your Content,
							or your use of the Services violate our Terms. If we do so, it’s important to understand that you don’t have
							a contractual or legal right to continue to use our Services, for example, to sell or buy on our websites or
							mobile apps. Generally, Flagship will notify you that your account has been terminated or suspended, unless
							you’ve repeatedly violated our Terms or we have legal or regulatory reasons preventing us from notifying
							you. </p>
						<br />
						<p>If you or Flagship terminate your account, you may lose any information associated with your account,
							including Your Content. </p>
						<br />
						<p>We May Discontinue the Services Flagship reserves the right to change, suspend, or discontinue any of the
							Services for you, any or all users, at any time, for any reason, including those laid out in Flagship’s
							policies under these Terms of Use. We will not be liable to you for the effect that any changes to the
							Services may have on you, including your income or your ability to generate revenue through the Services.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>Survival. The Terms will remain in effect even after your access to the Service is terminated, or your use of
							the Service ends. </p>
					</div>
				
					<div class="Restrictions-condition">
						<h2>8. Warranties and Limitation of Liability (or the Things You Can’t Sue Us For) </h2>
					</div>
					<div class="container terms-details">
						<p>Items You Purchase. You understand that Flagship does not manufacture, store, or inspect any of the items
							sold through our Services. We provide the venue; the items in our marketplaces are produced, listed, and
							sold directly by independent sellers, so Flagship cannot and does not make any warranties about their
							quality, safety, authenticity, or their legality. Any legal claim related to an item you purchase must be
							brought directly against the seller of the item. You release Flagship from any claims related to items sold
							through our Services, including for defective items, misrepresentations by sellers, or items that caused
							physical injury (like product liability claims).</p>
						<br />
						<p>Content You Access. You may come across materials that you find offensive or inappropriate while using our
							Services. We make no representations concerning any content posted by users through the Services. Flagship
							is not responsible for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of content posted by users
							that you accessed through the Services. You release us from all liability relating to that content. </p>
						<br />
						<p>People You Interact With. You can use the Services to interact with other individuals, either online or in
							person. However, you understand that we do not screen users of our Services other than to meet certain
							compliance and legal obligations, and you release us from all liability relating to your interactions with
							other users. Please be careful and exercise caution and good judgement in all interactions with others,
							especially if you are meeting someone in person. </p>
						<br />
						<p>Third-Party Services. Our Services may contain links to third-party websites or services that we don’t own or
							control (for example, links to Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest). You may also need to use a third party’s
							product or service in order to use some of our Services (like a compatible mobile device to use our mobile
							apps). When you access these third-party services, you do so at your own risk. The third parties may require
							you to accept their own terms of use. Flagship is not a party to those agreements; they are solely between
							you and the third party. </p>
						<br />
						<p>Gift Cards and Promotions. You acknowledge that Flagship does not make any warranties with respect to your
							Gift Card balance and is not responsible for any unauthorized access to, or alteration, theft, or
							destruction of a Gift Card or Gift Card code that results from any action by you or a third party. You also
							acknowledge that we may suspend or prohibit use of your Gift Card if your Gift Card or Gift Card code has
							been reported lost or stolen, or if we believe your Gift Card balance is being used suspiciously,
							fraudulently, or in an otherwise unauthorized manner. If your Gift Card code stops working, your only remedy
							is for us to issue you a replacement Gift Card code. By participating in a special offer or promotion, you
							agree that you may not later claim that the rules of that special offer or promotion were ambiguous. </p>
						<br />
						<p>| WARRANTIES. FLAGSHIP IS DEDICATED TO MAKING OUR SERVICES THE BEST THEY CAN BE, BUT WE’RE NOT PERFECT AND
							SOMETIMES THINGS CAN GO WRONG. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT OUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND "AS AVAILABLE"
							WITHOUT ANY KIND OF WARRANTY (EXPRESS OR IMPLIED). WE ARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMING ANY WARRANTIES OF TITLE,
							NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AS WELL AS ANY WARRANTIES IMPLIED
							BY A COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, COURSE OF DEALING, OR USAGE OF TRADE. </p>
						<br />
						<p>WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT: (I) THE SERVICES WILL BE SECURE OR AVAILABLE AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME OR LOCATION;
							(II) ANY DEFECTS OR ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED; (III) THE SERVICES WILL BE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL
							MATERIALS; OR (IV) THE RESULTS OF USING THE SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS. YOU USE THE SERVICES

						<p>We hope this never happens, but if Flagship gets sued or receives a claim, notice, or demand because of

							lawsuit, loss, liability, or expense of any kind (including reasonable lawyer’s fees) that arises from your

						<h2>11. Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver </h2>
					</div>
					<div class="container terms-details">
						<p>If you’re upset with us, let us know, and we’ll work together in good faith to resolve your issue. But if we
							can’t work it out, then you and Flagship (including our employees, officers, directors, agents,
							subsidiaries, and affiliates) agree to submit our disputes exclusively to binding individual arbitration,
							and we won’t sue each other in court before a judge or jury, except in the limited circumstances described
							below. </p>
						<br />
						<p>This Section 11 (which we’ll also refer to as the “Arbitration Agreement” or “Agreement”) applies only if you
							are a user in North or South America, and applies to the fullest extent allowable by law. </p>
						<br />
						<p>Please read this Section carefully, as it affects your rights. </p>
						<br />
						<p>A. Disputes that We’ll Arbitrate. You and Flagship agree to mandatory individual arbitration for all claims
							arising from or relating to the Services, these and prior versions of the Terms, any products, data, or
							content bought, sold, offered, accessed, displayed, transmitted, or listed through the Services, and actions
							or statements by Flagship or its users, in each case including disputes that arose before the effective date
							of these Terms (each, a “Dispute”). The exception is that we each may (1) bring qualifying individual claims
							in “small claims” court, so long as those claims remain in small claims court; and (2) seek injunctive
							relief in court for infringement or misuse of intellectual property rights (like trademarks, copyrights, and
							patents). All other Disputes must be arbitrated, which means you and Flagship are each waiving your right to
							sue in court and have a court or jury trial. </p>
						<br />
						<p>B. Class and Representative Action Waiver. You and Flagship agree that each of us may bring claims against
							the other only on an individual basis, and not on a class, representative, or collective basis (and we each
							waive any right we have to bring such claims). We each may only seek or obtain individualised relief, and,
							except as provided in Section 11.F (Batch Arbitration), disputes between us cannot be arbitrated or
							consolidated with those of any other person or entity. If a court (after exhaustion of all appeals) decides
							that any part of this Section 11.B is unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (e.g.,
							public injunctive relief), then solely that particular claim or request for relief shall be severed from the
							arbitration and may be litigated in court (but only after the arbitrator issues an award on the arbitrable
							claims and remedies). </p>
						<br />
						<p>C. Informal Dispute Resolution. Before filing an arbitration, you and Flagship will try in good faith to
							resolve any Dispute informally. To start the dispute process, you must send an individualized written notice
							(“Notice of Dispute”) to info@flagship.club that includes (1) your name, phone number, username and shop
							name (if applicable), and email address for your account, and (2) a description of the Dispute and how you’d
							like it resolved. If Flagship has a Dispute with you, we will send a Notice of Dispute with the same
							information to the email address for your account. Once a complete Notice of Dispute has been received, the
							recipient has 60 days to investigate the claims. If either side requests a settlement conference during this
							period, then you and Flagship must cooperate to schedule that meeting by phone or videoconference. You and
							Flagship each will personally participate and can each bring counsel, but the conference must be
							individualized, even if the same firm(s) represent multiple parties. For the claims in the Notice of
							Dispute, any statute of limitations will be tolled from the date the notice is received until the later of
							(i) 60 days, or (ii) after a timely requested settlement conference is completed (“Informal Resolution
							Period”). An arbitration cannot be filed until the Informal Resolution Period has ended, and a court can
							enjoin the filing or prosecution of an arbitration in breach of this Section. </p>
						<br />
						<p>D. Arbitration Rules and Procedures. To initiate arbitration, either you or we must file an arbitration
							demand with the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). You may serve Flagship with any arbitration demand
							by post to: Flagship, Inc. c/o The Corporation Trust Company, 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, DE 19801. If
							Flagship has a dispute with you, we will send an arbitration demand to the email address for your account.
							If the AAA cannot or will not administer the arbitration in accordance with Section 11, you and we will
							select another provider (and if we can’t agree, a court will choose the provider). </p>
						<br />
						<p>The arbitration will be conducted in the English language by a single arbitrator. The arbitration hearing (if
							any) will be held by videoconference, unless either party requests an in-person hearing and the arbitrator
							agrees. If an in-person hearing is required, it will be held in the county where you live (for US
							residents), New York County, New York (for non-US residents), or as determined by the arbitrator (in the
							case of Batch Arbitration). </p>
						<br />
						<p>The arbitration will be decided under AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules, as modified by this Agreement. But if
							you are using the Services as a business and either your or Flagship’s claims exceed $75,000, the AAA’s
							Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply, as modified by this Agreement. As in court, the arbitrator shall
							apply governing law, any counsel must comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), and the arbitrator
							may impose any sanctions available under the AAA Rules, Rule 11, or other applicable law. The arbitrator
							also shall enforce statutes of limitations and other time-based defences, offers of judgement/compromise and
							fee-shifting rules in the same way as a court would. </p>
						<br />
						<p>The arbitrator will have exclusive authority to resolve all issues, except that a court has exclusive
							authority to decide issues related to the arbitrability of a dispute, the enforceability of any part of this
							Section 11 (Arbitration and Dispute Resolution Agreement), and either party’s compliance with Section 11.C
							(Informal Dispute Resolution). Except as provided in Section 11.F (Batch Arbitration), the arbitrator can
							award damages and other relief only in favour of the individual claimant, and only to the extent necessary
							to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim(s). The arbitrator will not be bound by
							decisions reached in other arbitrations. The arbitrator’s award is final and binding on you and Flagship.
							Judgement on the award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction. </p>
						<br />
						<p>E. Arbitration Fees. Payment of all filing, case-management, administrative, hearing, and arbitrator fees
							(“Arbitration Fees”) will be governed by the AAA’s rules and fee schedules, unless otherwise stated in this
							Arbitration Agreement. If you are a consumer and your share of Arbitration Fees is more than you’d otherwise
							pay in court, let us know, and Flagship will pay the difference on your behalf. </p>
						<br />
						<p>F. Batch Arbitration. To ensure efficient resolution, if within a 90-day period, 25 or more claimants submit
							Notices of Dispute or file arbitrations raising similar claims (i.e., with the same or similar facts or
							events and legal issues) and are represented by the same or coordinated counsel, the disputes must be
							arbitrated in batches of up to 50 claimants each (“Batch”). Specifically, upon notice from either side, the
							AAA shall group the claimants into: (1) a single Batch (if there are 25-50 claimants), or (2) Batches of 50
							claimants each, with a smaller, final Batch consisting of any remaining claimants (if there are more than 50
							claimants). The AAA shall thereafter provide for the resolution of each Batch as a single consolidated
							arbitration with a single arbitrator appointed by the AAA, one set of Arbitration Fees, and one hearing (if
							any) per Batch to be held by videoconference (or in a place decided by the arbitrator). The parties will
							cooperate in good faith to implement this process and minimize the time and costs of arbitration. Any
							challenges to administrative determinations by AAA shall be heard by a single process arbitrator. If this
							Section 11.F is deemed unenforceable as to a particular claimant or Batch, then it shall be severed as to
							that claimant or Batch, and those parties shall arbitrate in individual proceedings. </p>
						<br />
						<p>G. Opt out. You have a limited right to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement (excluding Section 11.I).
							Specifically, iIf you are a new user of our Services, you can opt out of this Arbitration Agreement within
							30 days after you first accept the Terms. If you are an existing user of our Services, you can opt out
							within 30 days after the effective date (listed above). To opt out, you must send a timely email to
							rach@flagship.club with your name, the email address for your account, your username and your shop name (if
							applicable), and a request to opt out of arbitration. If you validly opt out, neither Flagship nor you will
							be required to arbitrate as a result of this (or any prior version of the) Arbitration Agreement, but the
							Terms (and any other agreements between us) will otherwise apply to you. If we update the Terms after you
							validly opt out, we will continue to respect your opt-out, but such updates do not provide a new opportunity
							to opt out of arbitration.</p>
						<br />
						<p>H. Future Changes to the Arbitration Agreement. Flagship will notify you of material changes to this
							Arbitration Agreement at least 30 days before they become effective. You may reject future changes to the
							Arbitration Agreement by emailing info@flagship.club within 30 days after you receive notice, including your
							name, email address associated with your account, and your Flagship account(s). Otherwise, you’ll be bound
							by the change, and the modified Arbitration Agreement shall apply to all Disputes between you and Flagship,
							including those arising before the effective date of the changes, but excluding any claims pending in
							arbitration (or court, if permitted) as of the effective date. If you reject a change, you’ll be bound by
							the most recent version of the Arbitration Agreement before the change you rejected. </p>
						<br />
						<p>I. Choice of Law and Forum. Flagship is based in New York, so if there are claims between you and Flagship
							that aren’t subject to arbitration, you and Flagship each agree to litigate those claims exclusively in
							state or federal court in New York County, New York, and to submit to the personal jurisdiction of those
							courts. The exception is if you file in small claims court – you can do that in the county of your
							residence. Except as prohibited by law, these Terms, and all disputes between us, shall be governed
							exclusively by New York law, without regard to conflict-of-law rules, and U.S. federal law (including the
							Federal Arbitration Act). For clarity, this Section 11.I will continue to apply even if you validly opt out
							of arbitration under Section 11.G. </p>

					<div class="Restrictions-condition">
						<h2>12. Changes to the Terms </h2>
					</div>
					<div class="container terms-details">
						<p>We may update these Terms from time to time, including by adding entirely new terms and deleting existing
							terms. If the changes are material, we’ll let you know in advance by posting the changes through the
							Services and/or sending you an email or message about the changes. Your use of the Services after the
							effective date of the changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms. If you do not agree with the
							changes, you may close your account. </p>
					</div>
				
					<div class="Restrictions-condition">
						<h2>13. Some Finer Legal Points </h2>
					</div>
					<div class="container terms-details">
						<p>The Terms, including all of the policies that make up the Terms, supersede any other agreement between you
							and Flagship regarding the Services. Except as provided in Section 11, if any part of the Terms is found to
							be invalid or unenforceable, that part will be limited to the minimum extent necessary and severed so that
							the Terms will otherwise remain in full force and effect. Our failure to enforce any part of the Terms is
							not a waiver of our right to later enforce that or any other part of the Terms. We may assign any of our
							rights and obligations under the Terms. </p>
