                    <p>This document and the other documents that we reference below make up our house rules, or what we officially
                        call our Terms of Use (the “Terms” for short). </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>The Terms are a legally binding contract between you and Flagship. If you live in North America or South
                        America, the contract is between you and Flagship, Inc.; if you live elsewhere, the contract is between you
                        and Flagship. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Please note that Section 11 contains an arbitration clause and class action waiver, applicable to users in
                        North and South America, and explains how to opt out of arbitration. Unless you validly opt out, you agree
                        to resolve any disputes with Flagship exclusively through binding individual arbitration, with only limited
                        exceptions. This means you and Flagship are waiving the right to sue in court, have a trial by jury, or
                        participate in a class or representative action. Please read this Section carefully, as it affects your
                        rights. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>This contract sets out your rights and responsibilities when you use Flagship.com, Pattern by Flagship, our
                        mobile apps, and the other services provided by Flagship (we’ll refer to all of these collectively as our
                        “Services”), so please read it carefully. By using any of our Services (even just browsing one of our
                        websites or apps), you’re agreeing to the Terms. If you don’t agree with the Terms, you may not use our
                        Services. Agree with us? Great, read on! </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Flagship’s Services connect people around the world, both online and offline, to make, sell, and buy unique
                        goods. Here’s a handy guide to help you understand the specific rules that are relevant for you, depending
                        on how you use the Services. Through our mentorship program we guide young entrepreneurs on the ins and outs

                    <p>We know your personal information is important to you, so it’s important to us. Our Privacy Policy details
                        how your information is collected, used and shared when you use our Services. By using our Services, you're
                        also agreeing that we can process your information in the ways set out in the Privacy Policy, so please read

                    <p>Both Flagship and sellers process members’ personal information (for example, buyer name, email address, and
                        delivery address) and are therefore considered separate and independent data controllers of buyers’ personal
                        information under EU law. That means that each party is responsible for the personal information it
                        processes in providing the Services. For example, if a seller accidentally discloses a buyer’s name and
                        email address when fulfilling another buyer’s order, the seller, not Flagship, will be responsible for that
                        unauthorized disclosure. </p>

                <div class="container terms-details">
                    <p>You’ll need to create an account with Flagship to use some of our Services. Here are a few rules about
                        accounts with Flagship: </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>A. Minors under 18 and at least 13 years of age are only permitted to use our Services through an account
                        owned by a parent or legal guardian with their appropriate permission and under their direct supervision.
                        Children under 13 years are not permitted to use Flagship or the Services. You/Parent/Legal Guardian will be
                        responsible for any and all account activity conducted by a minor on your account, and there may be
                        commercial products or services available that you may want to consider to limit a minor's access to
                        material online. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>B. Be honest with us. Provide accurate information about yourself. It’s prohibited to use false information
                        or impersonate another person or company through your account. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>C. Choose an appropriate name. If you decide to not have your full name serve as the name associated with
                        your account, you may not use language that is offensive, vulgar, infringes someone’s intellectual property
                        rights, or otherwise violates the Terms. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>D. You're responsible for your account. You’re solely responsible for any activity on your account. If you’re
                        sharing an account with other people, then the person whose financial information is on the account will
                        ultimately be responsible for all activity. If you’re registering as a business entity, you personally
                        guarantee that you have the authority to agree to the Terms on behalf of the business. Also, your accounts
                        are not transferable. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>E. Protect your password. As we mentioned above, you’re solely responsible for any activity on your account,
                        so it’s important to keep your account password secure. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>F. Let's be clear about our relationship. These Terms don't create any agency, partnership, joint venture,
                        employment, or franchisee relationship between you and Flagship. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>G. Cases and Appeals. To participate in our case system (as described in Section 10), or to appeal an action
                        by Flagship, you must have an account. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>H. You agree to pay 5% on sale of products through Flagship website. </p>
                    <br />

                <div class="container terms-details">
                    <p>Content that you post using our Services is your content (so let’s refer to it as “Your Content”). We don’t
                        make any claim to it, which includes anything you post using our Services (like shop names, profile
                        pictures, listing photos, listing descriptions, reviews, comments, videos, usernames, etc.). </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>A. Responsibility for Your Content. You understand that you are solely responsible for Your Content. You
                        represent that you have all necessary rights to all parts of Your Content and that you’re not infringing or
                        violating any third party’s rights by posting it. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>B. Permission to Use Your Content. By posting Your Content through our Services, you grant Flagship and, as
                        authorized by Flagship in its sole discretion, third parties, a license to use it. We don’t claim any
                        ownership to Your Content, but we have your permission to use it to help Flagship function and grow. That
                        way, we won’t infringe any rights you have in Your Content and we can help promote it. For example, you
                        acknowledge and agree Flagship may offer you or Flagship buyers promotions on the Site, from time to time,
                        that may relate to your listings or other listings on Flagship. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>C. Rights You Grant Flagship. (Here’s the legalese version of the last section). By posting Your Content, you
                        grant Flagship and, as authorized by Flagship in its sole discretion, third parties, a non-exclusive,
                        worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, sub-licensable, perpetual license to use, display, edit, modify,
                        reproduce, distribute, store, and prepare derivative works of Your Content. This allows us to provide the
                        Services and to promote Flagship, your Flagship shop, other shops and listings, or the Services in general,
                        in any formats and through any channels, including across any Flagship Services, our partners, or
                        third-party website or advertising medium. You agree not to assert any moral rights or rights of publicity
                        against us for using Your Content. You also recognize our legitimate interest in using it, in accordance
                        with the scope of this license, to the extent Your Content contains any personal information. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>That sounds like a lot, but it’s necessary for us to keep Flagship going. Consider these examples: if you
                        upload a photo or video of a listing on your Flagship shop, we have permission to display it to buyers, and
                        we can resize or enhance it so it looks good to a buyer using our mobile app; if you post a description in
                        English, we can translate it into French so a buyer in Paris can learn the story behind your item; and if
                        you post a beautiful photo or video of your latest handmade necklace, we can feature it - often along with
                        your shop name and shop picture - on our homepage, in one of our blogs or even on a billboard to help
                        promote your business and Flagship’s. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>D. Reporting Unauthorized Content. Flagship has great respect for intellectual property rights, and is
                        committed to following appropriate legal procedures to remove infringing content from the Services. If
                        content that you own or have rights to has been posted to the Services without your permission and you want
                        it removed, please mail us at our official email account info@flagship.club If Your Content is alleged to
                        infringe another person’s intellectual property, we will take appropriate action, such as disabling it if we
                        receive a report of infringement that complies with our policies, or terminating your account if you are
                        found to be a repeat infringer. We’ll notify you if any of that happens. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>E. Inappropriate, False, or Misleading Content. This should be common sense, but there are certain types of
                        content we don’t want posted on Flagship’s Services (for legal reasons or otherwise). You agree that you
                        will not post any content that is abusive, threatening, defamatory, obscene, vulgar, or otherwise offensive
                        content. You also agree not to post any content that is false and misleading or uses the Services in a
                        manner that is fraudulent or deceptive. </p>

                    <br />
                    <p>A. Don’t Use Our Services to Break the Law. You agree that you will not violate any laws in connection with
                        your use of the Services. This includes any local, state, federal, and international laws that may apply to
                        you. For example, it’s your responsibility to obtain any permits or licenses that your shop requires, and to

                        prohibits the laws; and you may not engage in fraud (including false claims or infringement notices), theft,
                        anti-competitive conduct, threatening conduct, or any other unlawful acts or crimes against Flagship,

                    <p>B. Pay Your Bills. You are responsible for paying all fees that you owe to Flagship. Except as set forth
                        below, you are also solely responsible for collecting and/or paying any applicable taxes for any purchases
                        or sales you make through our Services. Where applicable, Flagship will calculate, collect and remit

                        acknowledge that we may suspend or prohibit use of your Gift Card if your Gift Card or Gift Card code has
                        been reported lost or stolen, or if we believe your Gift Card balance is being used suspiciously,

                        is for us to issue you a replacement Gift Card code. By participating in a special offer or promotion, you

                <div class="container terms-details">
                    <p>If you’re upset with us, let us know, and we’ll work together in good faith to resolve your issue. But if we
                        can’t work it out, then you and Flagship (including our employees, officers, directors, agents,
                        subsidiaries, and affiliates) agree to submit our disputes exclusively to binding individual arbitration,
                        and we won’t sue each other in court before a judge or jury, except in the limited circumstances described
                        below. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>This Section 11 (which we’ll also refer to as the “Arbitration Agreement” or “Agreement”) applies only if you
                        are a user in North or South America, and applies to the fullest extent allowable by law. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Please read this Section carefully, as it affects your rights. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>A. Disputes that We’ll Arbitrate. You and Flagship agree to mandatory individual arbitration for all claims
                        arising from or relating to the Services, these and prior versions of the Terms, any products, data, or
                        content bought, sold, offered, accessed, displayed, transmitted, or listed through the Services, and actions
                        or statements by Flagship or its users, in each case including disputes that arose before the effective date
                        of these Terms (each, a “Dispute”). The exception is that we each may (1) bring qualifying individual claims
                        in “small claims” court, so long as those claims remain in small claims court; and (2) seek injunctive
                        relief in court for infringement or misuse of intellectual property rights (like trademarks, copyrights, and
                        patents). All other Disputes must be arbitrated, which means you and Flagship are each waiving your right to
                        sue in court and have a court or jury trial. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>B. Class and Representative Action Waiver. You and Flagship agree that each of us may bring claims against
                        the other only on an individual basis, and not on a class, representative, or collective basis (and we each
                        waive any right we have to bring such claims). We each may only seek or obtain individualised relief, and,
                        except as provided in Section 11.F (Batch Arbitration), disputes between us cannot be arbitrated or
                        consolidated with those of any other person or entity. If a court (after exhaustion of all appeals) decides
                        that any part of this Section 11.B is unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (e.g.,
                        public injunctive relief), then solely that particular claim or request for relief shall be severed from the
                        arbitration and may be litigated in court (but only after the arbitrator issues an award on the arbitrable
                        claims and remedies). </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>C. Informal Dispute Resolution. Before filing an arbitration, you and Flagship will try in good faith to
                        resolve any Dispute informally. To start the dispute process, you must send an individualized written notice
                        (“Notice of Dispute”) to info@flagship.club that includes (1) your name, phone number, username and shop
                        name (if applicable), and email address for your account, and (2) a description of the Dispute and how you’d
                        like it resolved. If Flagship has a Dispute with you, we will send a Notice of Dispute with the same
                        information to the email address for your account. Once a complete Notice of Dispute has been received, the
                        recipient has 60 days to investigate the claims. If either side requests a settlement conference during this
                        period, then you and Flagship must cooperate to schedule that meeting by phone or videoconference. You and
                        Flagship each will personally participate and can each bring counsel, but the conference must be
                        individualized, even if the same firm(s) represent multiple parties. For the claims in the Notice of
                        Dispute, any statute of limitations will be tolled from the date the notice is received until the later of
                        (i) 60 days, or (ii) after a timely requested settlement conference is completed (“Informal Resolution
                        Period”). An arbitration cannot be filed until the Informal Resolution Period has ended, and a court can
                        enjoin the filing or prosecution of an arbitration in breach of this Section. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>D. Arbitration Rules and Procedures. To initiate arbitration, either you or we must file an arbitration
                        demand with the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). You may serve Flagship with any arbitration demand
                        by post to: Flagship, Inc. c/o The Corporation Trust Company, 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, DE 19801. If
                        Flagship has a dispute with you, we will send an arbitration demand to the email address for your account.
                        If the AAA cannot or will not administer the arbitration in accordance with Section 11, you and we will
                        select another provider (and if we can’t agree, a court will choose the provider). </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>The arbitration will be conducted in the English language by a single arbitrator. The arbitration hearing (if
                        any) will be held by videoconference, unless either party requests an in-person hearing and the arbitrator
                        agrees. If an in-person hearing is required, it will be held in the county where you live (for US
                        residents), New York County, New York (for non-US residents), or as determined by the arbitrator (in the
                        case of Batch Arbitration). </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>The arbitration will be decided under AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules, as modified by this Agreement. But if
                        you are using the Services as a business and either your or Flagship’s claims exceed $75,000, the AAA’s
                        Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply, as modified by this Agreement. As in court, the arbitrator shall
                        apply governing law, any counsel must comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), and the arbitrator
                        may impose any sanctions available under the AAA Rules, Rule 11, or other applicable law. The arbitrator
                        also shall enforce statutes of limitations and other time-based defences, offers of judgement/compromise and
                        fee-shifting rules in the same way as a court would. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>The arbitrator will have exclusive authority to resolve all issues, except that a court has exclusive
                        authority to decide issues related to the arbitrability of a dispute, the enforceability of any part of this
                        Section 11 (Arbitration and Dispute Resolution Agreement), and either party’s compliance with Section 11.C
                        (Informal Dispute Resolution). Except as provided in Section 11.F (Batch Arbitration), the arbitrator can
                        award damages and other relief only in favour of the individual claimant, and only to the extent necessary
                        to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim(s). The arbitrator will not be bound by
                        decisions reached in other arbitrations. The arbitrator’s award is final and binding on you and Flagship.
                        Judgement on the award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>E. Arbitration Fees. Payment of all filing, case-management, administrative, hearing, and arbitrator fees
                        (“Arbitration Fees”) will be governed by the AAA’s rules and fee schedules, unless otherwise stated in this
                        Arbitration Agreement. If you are a consumer and your share of Arbitration Fees is more than you’d otherwise
                        pay in court, let us know, and Flagship will pay the difference on your behalf. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>F. Batch Arbitration. To ensure efficient resolution, if within a 90-day period, 25 or more claimants submit
                        Notices of Dispute or file arbitrations raising similar claims (i.e., with the same or similar facts or
                        events and legal issues) and are represented by the same or coordinated counsel, the disputes must be
                        arbitrated in batches of up to 50 claimants each (“Batch”). Specifically, upon notice from either side, the
                        AAA shall group the claimants into: (1) a single Batch (if there are 25-50 claimants), or (2) Batches of 50
                        claimants each, with a smaller, final Batch consisting of any remaining claimants (if there are more than 50
                        claimants). The AAA shall thereafter provide for the resolution of each Batch as a single consolidated
                        arbitration with a single arbitrator appointed by the AAA, one set of Arbitration Fees, and one hearing (if
                        any) per Batch to be held by videoconference (or in a place decided by the arbitrator). The parties will
                        cooperate in good faith to implement this process and minimize the time and costs of arbitration. Any
                        challenges to administrative determinations by AAA shall be heard by a single process arbitrator. If this
                        Section 11.F is deemed unenforceable as to a particular claimant or Batch, then it shall be severed as to
                        that claimant or Batch, and those parties shall arbitrate in individual proceedings. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>G. Opt out. You have a limited right to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement (excluding Section 11.I).
                        Specifically, iIf you are a new user of our Services, you can opt out of this Arbitration Agreement within
                        30 days after you first accept the Terms. If you are an existing user of our Services, you can opt out
                        within 30 days after the effective date (listed above). To opt out, you must send a timely email to
                        rach@flagship.club with your name, the email address for your account, your username and your shop name (if
                        applicable), and a request to opt out of arbitration. If you validly opt out, neither Flagship nor you will
                        be required to arbitrate as a result of this (or any prior version of the) Arbitration Agreement, but the
                        Terms (and any other agreements between us) will otherwise apply to you. If we update the Terms after you
                        validly opt out, we will continue to respect your opt-out, but such updates do not provide a new opportunity
                        to opt out of arbitration.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>H. Future Changes to the Arbitration Agreement. Flagship will notify you of material changes to this
                        Arbitration Agreement at least 30 days before they become effective. You may reject future changes to the
                        Arbitration Agreement by emailing info@flagship.club within 30 days after you receive notice, including your
                        name, email address associated with your account, and your Flagship account(s). Otherwise, you’ll be bound
                        by the change, and the modified Arbitration Agreement shall apply to all Disputes between you and Flagship,
                        including those arising before the effective date of the changes, but excluding any claims pending in
                        arbitration (or court, if permitted) as of the effective date. If you reject a change, you’ll be bound by
                        the most recent version of the Arbitration Agreement before the change you rejected. </p>

                    <p>I. Choice of Law and Forum. Flagship is based in New York, so if there are claims between you and Flagship
                        that aren’t subject to arbitration, you and Flagship each agree to litigate those claims exclusively in
                        state or federal court in New York County, New York, and to submit to the personal jurisdiction of those
                        courts. The exception is if you file in small claims court – you can do that in the county of your
                        residence. Except as prohibited by law, these Terms, and all disputes between us, shall be governed
                        exclusively by New York law, without regard to conflict-of-law rules, and U.S. federal law (including the
                        Federal Arbitration Act). For clarity, this Section 11.I will continue to apply even if you validly opt out
                        of arbitration under Section 11.G. </p>

                    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time, including by adding entirely new terms and deleting existing
                        terms. If the changes are material, we’ll let you know in advance by posting the changes through the
                        Services and/or sending you an email or message about the changes. Your use of the Services after the
                        effective date of the changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms. If you do not agree with the

                    <p>The Terms, including all of the policies that make up the Terms, supersede any other agreement between you
                        and Flagship regarding the Services. Except as provided in Section 11, if any part of the Terms is found to
                        be invalid or unenforceable, that part will be limited to the minimum extent necessary and severed so that
                        the Terms will otherwise remain in full force and effect. Our failure to enforce any part of the Terms is
                        not a waiver of our right to later enforce that or any other part of the Terms. We may assign any of our
                        rights and obligations under the Terms. </p>
